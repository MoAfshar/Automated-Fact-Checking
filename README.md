# Automated-Fact-Checking
Due to a large amount of online misinformation spreading through the years, automated fact checking has become a popular research area. This project develops and uses different methods of information retrieval and data mining techniques to assess the accuracy of a claim. Three main steps are evaluated in this project consisted of: 
- relevant document retrieval
- evidence selection and claim veracity
- prediction as well a thorough literature review 

The publicly available Fact Extraction and Verification (FEVER) dataset will be used to solve the research oriented questions. This project consists of solving several subtasks starting from simple: 
- text statistics 
- vector space document retrieval 
- probabilistic document retrieval 
- sentence relevance and evaluation and truthfulness of claims 

To identify sentence relevance a logistic regression model was created and for the truthfulness of claims multiple neural nets were created to test the quality and performance of the architecture.
